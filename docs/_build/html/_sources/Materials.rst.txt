Materials List
==============

[TODO] this should have descriptions of what each part is used for, and a column detailing where to acquire it (print/buy/etc) and if lathing them is a possibility

A note on acquiring materials:

Some of the required parts for this project would most easily be 3d printed. These parts are listed under the 3d Printing section.

Frame
_____

The frame is plywood, commonly referred to as laser plywood (any plywood with roughly the correct thickness will work). We recommend 5mm width, though you may have success with 6mm sheets as well.

The sheet(s) should be large enough to cut the following plans from: [TODO: ADD LINK]

Sourcing the material: This should be very easy to acquire. Look for 2 sheets of 600mm x 400mm, such as here:
