Building Guide
==============

This building guide is divided into 3 main sections:

:ref:`External Assembly`

:ref:`Internal Assembly`

:ref:`Electronics Assembly`


External Assembly
________________


Frame
-----

Material needed:

All the plywood frame pieces:

- Face
- Back
- Bottom
- Left
- Right


Make sure the holes in the plywood pieces are arranged like the following picture. The rounded pegs will become feet, so make sure they are facing downward. These pegs are identified with red dots.

.. _center:

           :align: center

You can now glue the pieces together with wood glue, but you may want to wait until the internal components are assembled. This can make it easier to work with assemblies like the guide rods. So, for now just snap the 5 pieces together and tape the corners as seen in :numref:`taped`:

Y-direction Motor Assembly
--------------------------

Materials needed:

* Y motor support:
    .. _ymotor:
    .. image:: ./Images/YMotorsupport.png
            :width: 200

* 2 M3 washers
* 2 M3-12 screws
* 2 Nylstop M3 Hex nuts
* 4 M3-8 screws
* 1 GT2 pulley, 20 teeth, 5mm
* 1 Nema 17 motor

====

1. Add the Y Motor support to the rotating end of the Nema motor, with the motor power connector facing upwards as shown.

2. Place the hex nuts into the hex nut grooves in the 3d-printed Y motor support.

   The Y-motor is now assembled, and it is time to attach it to the frame.

3. Attach the Y-motor assembly to the frame. Take care that it is facing in the correct direction relative to the holes in the bottom of the frame, as shown.
