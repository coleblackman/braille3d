What this project is
--------------------

Braille3d is a set of documentation and resources for constructing a braille printer capable of printing a4, blind-legible documents.
A printer constructed using this project should be:

- Cost-effective
- Extensible
- Easy to maintain
- Simple and reliable

This is a project to redesign and complete the original French BrailleRap-SP documentation. All credit for the design of the printer goes to: Philippe Pacotte and Stéphane Godin.

Unfortunately, progress on the initial project has stalled, so this is an effort to pick up where the original team left off.


Who it is for
-------------

This project should be doable by a team of students or hobbyists with access to the following:

- A laser cutter or some other way to cut the plywood according to spec
- A 3d printer
- Basic shop tools such as an electric drill and screwdrivers
- The materials listed in the Materials section

When all materials have been sourced, the project should require several weeks to construct.

A note on BrailleRap-SP vs Braille3d
------------------------------------

BrailleRap-SP is the original project this documentation is based on, though the designs have been modified somewhat.
Braille3d is an effort to complete the documentation of BrailleRap.
