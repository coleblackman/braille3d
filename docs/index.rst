This is a project to redesign and complete the original French BrailleRap-SP documentation. All credit for the design of the printer goes to: Philippe Pacotte and Stéphane Godin.

Unfortunately, progress on the initial project has stalled, so this is an effort to pick up where the original team left off.

The original documentation was released under the CERN Open Hardware License, as is this repository. Thus, the all documentation is free to study, modify, and share. 

About the project
=================

The goal of this project is to produce complete and easily reproducible documentation for construction of a braille printer/embosser for the production of blind-legible texts.

It is based on, and shares much of its design and layout with, BrailleRap-SP. At times, however, the design, layout, and models diverge from the original BrailleRap-SP, and as such it is a distinct project.

Further goals of the project include: 
- Complete English documentation
- Modifying of designs to accommodate more easily-acquired parts
- Beginner-oriented and student-accessible documentation
- Simplification of design choices
